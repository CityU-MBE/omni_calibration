# Omnidirectional Camera Calibration Toolbox

This is a calibration toolbox for omnidirectional cameras which can be used with MATLAB.
The most common omnidirectional camera models can be used for calibration and the toolbox has good corner extraction capabilities even for quite distorted omnidirectional images.

The toolbox is based on [LIBOMNICAL](http://www.cvlibs.net/projects/omnicam/) [1].

This toolbox fixes some bugs, adds some additional features and was mainly used and tested with the Mei model. 
Therefore the other model implementations need probably some bug fixes too and everybody is welcome to contribute!

The idea is to have a *general omnidirectional camera calibration toolbox* for all the common models and a platform for future model implementations.


### Camera Models

This toolbox incorporates the following models:

* Mei Model [2]
* Central Model (KIT) [1]
* Geometric Model (KIT) [1]
* Scaramuzza Model* [3]
* Geyer Model* [4]

\* There may be some bugs with these models. Please help to improve this toolbox.


# Usage

## 1. Installation

1. Adapt the path in the file **_init.m_**
2. Run `init` in MATLAB
3. Run `make` (only necessary for models from [1])


## 2. Calibration

1. Adapt the configuration file **_config.m_**
2. For calibration with new images: clear *grid.mat* and *images.mat* in the *data* directory
3. Run `start_omnical` in the MATLAB command window and follow the instructions


## 3. Output

* Calibration parameters in: 
  - calib\_####.mat in *data/calibration_name*
  - For Mei Model also saved in *Result\_Mei\_###.txt* and printed on the screen
* Reprojection Error in: 
  - data/calibration_name/Method_method/Repro_Error.mat*
* Visualizations:
  - Reprojection Error for all checkerboards:
    *data/calibration_name/Method_method/Repro\_Error\_Cam.png*
  - Reprojected (magenta) and extracted corners (green) in the images:
        *data/calibration_name/Methodmethod/Result\_Img\_0000\_01.png*
  - 3D Calibration Pattern Position:
        *data/\calibration\_name/Method\_\method/3D\_Checkerboards.png*


## 4. Projection

Use the calibration to project a 3D world point to a 2D image point with *reprojection.m*: 

`u = reprojection ( param, X, method, cams)`

* `u`   - 2D image point
* `param`   - calibration result (load the results from the data folder first)
* `X`   - 3D world point
* `method`  - projection and calibration method
* `cams`    - number for which cam the points are projected
